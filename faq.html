        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)</h2>
        <h3><a href="#">What is the Difference Between Compound and Isolation Workouts?</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> Compound workouts challenge many muscles at the same time, thus enabling faster and more well-rounded results. Isolation exercises (which, as you probably guessed, work one muscle at a time), do offer certain benefits for the extremely dedicated.
                However, beginners and even intermediate-level fitness enthusiasts should always start with compound exercises as the foundation of their training, and consider adding a few isolation exercises later.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#"> What are the Main Muscle Groups Every Bodybuilder Should Be Hitting?</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> The six major muscle groups are generally considered to be the chest, back, arms, shoulders, upper legs, and lower legs. Six compound exercises that effectively work all the important muscles in each respective group are: incline bench press
                (chest), bent over row (back), close-grip chin ups (arms), military press (shoulders), squats (upper legs), and lunges (both upper and lower legs).
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">Is Cardio Counterproductive for those Looking to “Bulk Up?”</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> There are no simple answers to this question. On the positive side, cardio helps stimulate healthy muscle recovery while improving the body’s metabolic response to nutrients, stimulating the appetite, and making transitions between bulking
                and cutting smoother. At the same time, cardio also has negative effects, such as burning fuel (calories) and contributing to overtraining. The bottom line? Adding cardio is probably the healthiest choice, though it may cause muscle gain
                to happen a bit slower.</p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#"> Which is More Productive: Less Weight/More Reps or More Weight/Less Reps?</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> Both lifting methods offer their own distinct set of benefits. Less weight and more reps leads to better endurance and faster lean muscle growth. More weight and less reps causes larger muscles and overall higher strength. A combination of
                both techniques may be the most productive strategy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">What Are Bulk/Cut Cycles and Are They Effective?</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p>Though this has long been accepted as the best way for professional bodybuilders to look “huge” during the contest season, the best way to look, feel and be healthy and attractive year round is simply living a healthy lifestyle, hitting the
                gym hard, and eating a consistently proportioned and nutrition-rich diet.</p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">How Long Before I Start Seeing Results?</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p>This depends on your definition of “seeing.” You are likely to begin decreasing running times, increasing weight lifts, and maybe even shedding pounds all within the first month of beginning a fitness routine. However, if you are hoping to
                instantly attain a “beach bod,” you are only setting yourself up for disappointment. Physical changes in your body take many months to manifest themselves, so be patient and enjoy your healthy lifestyle day by day — the results will follow!</p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#"> If I do sit ups or abdominal crunches everyday, will i get a six pack? </a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> No, doing sit-ups or crunches alone will not give you a six pack. Chances are you already have a six pack; it's just covered with a layer of fat. Cardio combined with a good healthy nutritional intake (as outlined over these chapters) and
                selective abdominal exercises (2-3 times per week) will give you a six pack.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">Being a female, if i start weight training would i be able to bulk up and grow big muscles?</a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> No, females do not have the amount of testosterone necessary to build "big" muscles quickly like men unless they are following a proper exercise and nutritional regime customized for muscle gain.

        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">  When i finish the program, am I going to put back the body fat I lost and lose the muscles?   </a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> No, providing you do at least one whole body work out once per week and maintain a healthy eating plan and eradicating carbohydrates in your last meal.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">If I am sweating does that mean I am burnung fat?  </a></h3>
        <div class="faqdiv">
            <p> No not necessarily. Sweating is the body's natural cooling system that regulates your temperature. You have probably noticed well conditioned people and athletes often sweat a lot and they probably don't have much body fat, but the real reason
                is that their body is conditioned more to regulate heat. Other contributing factors of sweating include levels of hydration in the body, foods eaten before exercise, body fat levels and the temperature and level of humidity in the surrounding
                environment.
